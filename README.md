My R&D report on the OSI model prepared during my internship.

# OSI Model – R&D Report

This repository contains a Research & Development (R&D) report on the **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model**, prepared as part of my **Cloud Infrastructure & Security Internship** at **Celebal Technology**.

## Report Overview

The OSI Model is a foundational framework in computer networking that divides the communication process into **seven distinct layers**. This report breaks down each layer with:

- Clear functional explanations  
- Real-world examples  
- Quotes and references from **Microsoft Learn**  
- A summary table for revision  
- A professional conclusion connecting OSI concepts to real-world applications like cloud infrastructure

## Files Included

- `OSI_Model_Report.pdf` – Final version of the R&D report  
- `OSI_Model_Report.docx` – Editable Word version (optional)  

## Topics Covered

- Introduction to the OSI Model  
- Seven-layer architecture explained in detail  
- Layer-specific protocols and devices  
- Mnemonics for easy memorization  
- Use of OSI in troubleshooting and modern network design  
- Comparison context with TCP/IP (for future extension)

## Purpose

This report was created as part of my ongoing internship learning tasks to demonstrate:
- My understanding of layered network communication  
- Ability to research, document, and reference technical concepts  
- Presentation of information in a structured, professional format
